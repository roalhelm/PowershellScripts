.SYNOPSIS
    Checks if devices listed in a CSV file exist in Azure Active Directory (AAD) and generates separate CSV files 
    for devices found and not found in AAD.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script reads a list of device names from a CSV file and checks each device against Azure AD.
    It creates two output files:
    - Devices_In_AAD.csv: Contains devices that were found in AAD
    - Devices_Not_In_AAD.csv: Contains devices that were not found in AAD
